QUESTION 5
A chemical reactor requires a starting temperature between 20.0°C and 40.0°C.
If the user enters a value outside this range, the system rejects it and forces
them to try again. However, for safety, the system only allows 3 total attempts
before locking down. Write a program in Java for the following technical specifications:

1. Variables:
• double temp.
• int attempts = 0.
• final int MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3.

2. The Loop:
• Use a do-while loop to ask for the temperature.

3. The Logic:
• Action: Increment the attempts count at the start of every loop.
• Validation: Inside the loop, check if the temperature is valid (20.0 <= temp <= 40.0).
• Termination: The loop should repeat only if:
• The temperature is NOT in the valid range.
• AND the attempts count is less than MAX_ATTEMPTS.

4. Output:
• If the input is invalid, print: "Invalid Temperature! Attempt [n] of 3 used.".
• After the loop, use an if statement to check if it ended because of a valid input
 or because it ran out of attempts.
• Print a final "System Status" message for either case.
